It contains the Tableau Analysis Report, Dashboard, and Story made on New York Citi Bike Data.

## Summary:
Citi Bike is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system serving the New York City with 20,000 bikes and over 1,300 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Jersey City. It was designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, and it’s a fun and affordable way to get around town.

Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so our aim is to build a set of data reports to provide the insights.
