# Tableau-Citi_Bike-Analysis_Dashboard
It contains the Tableau Analysis Report, Dashboard, and Story made on New York Citi Bike Data.

## Summary:
Citi Bike is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system serving the New York City with 20,000 bikes and over 1,300 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Jersey City. It was designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, and it’s a fun and affordable way to get around town.

Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so our aim is to build a set of data reports to provide the insights.

## About The Data:

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program’s utilization. Through the team’s efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
I have used the data of the popular month of September for the year of 2019 and 2020.

## Major Asks of the Project:
 - Connect with the business user and try to get the understanding about the KPI.
 - How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
 - How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
 - What are the peak hours in which bikes are used in different year?
 - What are the top 10 and bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?
 - What are the top 10 and bottom 10  stations in the city for ending a journey?
 - What is the gender breakdown of active participants?
 - How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?
 - How does the average trip duration change by age?
